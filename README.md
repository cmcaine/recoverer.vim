# recoverer.vim
Lightweight unintrusive alternative to 'Chrisbra/Recover.vim'

## Alternatives
* [Recover.vim](https://github.com/Chrisbra/Recover.vim) -- embeds '[d]iff'
variant into opening menu, which works poorly with neovim; can't be lazy
loaded.
* [vim-autoswap](https://github.com/gioele/vim-autoswap)
